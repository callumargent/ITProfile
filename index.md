I'm currently in my first year of tertiary study at RMIT. I enjoy rock climbing and story-driven computer games.

## Interest in IT
I have always has a fascination with new technology for as long as I can remember. The part of it that interests me most is that way that simple inputs can be taken, and processed into complex outputs, such as a relatively simply evolutionary AI script learning to play a game as fast as possible. One such example of this would be MarI/O, which begins with random input sequences and through training and many iterations is able to complete the entirety of Super Mario World. Another more recent example that I found interesting was when a fish beat Pokemon Sapphire after around 3200 hours, based on it's screen position on a camera. Examples such as these were what initiated my interest in machine learning, which today is being used in many ways to further society in things such as medicine, entertainment, and gaming, which one day I hope to contribute to. I currently have little IT experience, mainly focused around flash game development and website building, but after taking some time away from IT related interests to focus on work, I have decided to attempt to pursue a career in it.

### Study
I chose to study online at RMIT because it allowed me the most flexibility with work and other parts of life in general, providing me with a good balance. I also personally find studying online a lot more interactive and engaging than sitting in a classroom, allowing me to better focus on the content and absorb more of the information. It also allows me to study at my own pace and take the extra time I need to work through the course if other things come up.
