I'm currently in my first year of tertiary study at RMIT. I enjoy rock climbing and story-driven computer games, and I'm interested to see how the world of IT progresses in my lifetime.

## Interest in IT
I have always has a fascination with new technology for as long as I can remember. The part of it that interests me most is that way that simple inputs can be taken, and processed into complex outputs, such as a relatively simply evolutionary AI script learning to play a game as fast as possible. One such example of this would be MarI/O, which begins with random input sequences and through training and many iterations is able to complete the entirety of Super Mario World. Another more recent example that I found interesting was when a fish beat Pokemon Sapphire after around 3200 hours, based on it's screen position on a camera. Examples such as these were what initiated my interest in machine learning, which today is being used in many ways to further society in things such as medicine, entertainment, and gaming, which one day I hope to contribute to. I currently have little IT experience, mainly focused around flash game development and website building, but after taking some time away from IT related interests to focus on work, I have decided to attempt to pursue a career in it.

### Study
I chose to study online at RMIT because it allowed me the most flexibility with work and other parts of life in general, providing me with a good balance. I also personally find studying online a lot more interactive and engaging than sitting in a classroom, allowing me to better focus on the content and absorb more of the information. It also allows me to study at my own pace and take the extra time I need to work through the course if other things come up.

### Expectations
In my time at RMIT I hope to learn about the future of IT in terms of where we are headed, and what new technologies will come up and hopefully benefit us as a society. I am looking forward to developing my skills and opening up new career gateways, which in turn would lead to further connections and experience in the field. With technology changing and improving so rapidly, I feel as though I may be missing out on important developments, and so I hope that this course will inspire me to keep on top of this.

## Ideal Job
My dream job in the field of IT would be something like <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/52548355?type=standout#searchRequestToken=11240c32-6f22-4950-92e0-93884b0d03f2">this:</a> <br>

A position like this would involve working closely with a small team in order to maintain and update a system for an educational organisation. This interests me because I feel I work particularly well with small teams and the work required to be a system administrator is something I believe I could do. The skills required for this position would be a strong understanding of the implemented system in the event of a failure, and the ability to manage a team effectively to achieve goals in short timespans. I would have to have completed my IT degree and have worked in the industry of systems management for a couple of years before I would feel comfortable taking on a management role for a team like this. I currently have little relevant experience, the closest being setting up a small FTP server in my bedroom and managing the file systems on my personal devices. In order to obtain the skills I require, I would complete my degree, and spend 2-3 years in team positions in educational organisations and non-profits, such that I gain a decent amount of experience in the field and make sure that it is actually what I would like to pursue.
