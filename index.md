I'm currently in my first year of tertiary study at RMIT. I enjoy rock climbing and story-driven computer games, and I'm interested to see how the world of IT progresses in my lifetime.

## Interest in IT
I have always has a fascination with new technology for as long as I can remember. The part of it that interests me most is that way that simple inputs can be taken, and processed into complex outputs, such as a relatively simply evolutionary AI script learning to play a game as fast as possible. One such example of this would be MarI/O, which begins with random input sequences and through training and many iterations is able to complete the entirety of Super Mario World. Another more recent example that I found interesting was when a fish beat Pok√©mon Sapphire after around 3200 hours, based on its screen position on a camera. Examples such as these were what initiated my interest in machine learning, which today is being used in many ways to further society in things such as medicine, entertainment, and gaming, which one day I hope to contribute to. I currently have little IT experience, mainly focused around flash game development and website building, but after taking some time away from IT related interests to focus on work, I have decided to attempt to pursue a career in it.

### Study
I chose to study online at RMIT because it allowed me the most flexibility with work and other parts of life in general, providing me with a good balance. I also personally find studying online a lot more interactive and engaging than sitting in a classroom, allowing me to better focus on the content and absorb more of the information. It also allows me to study at my own pace and take the extra time I need to work through the course if other things come up.

### Expectations
In my time at RMIT I hope to learn about the future of IT in terms of where we are headed, and what new technologies will come up and hopefully benefit us as a society. I am looking forward to developing my skills and opening up new career gateways, which in turn would lead to further connections and experience in the field. With technology changing and improving so rapidly, I feel as though I may be missing out on important developments, and so I hope that this course will inspire me to keep on top of this.

## Ideal Job
My dream job in the field of IT would be something like <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/52548355?type=standout#searchRequestToken=11240c32-6f22-4950-92e0-93884b0d03f2">this:</a> <br>

A position like this would involve working closely with a small team in order to maintain and update a system for an educational organisation. This interests me because I feel I work particularly well with small teams and the work required to be a system administrator is something I believe I could do. The skills required for this position would be a strong understanding of the implemented system in the event of a failure, and the ability to manage a team effectively to achieve goals in short timespans. I would have to have completed my IT degree and have worked in the industry of systems management for a couple of years before I would feel comfortable taking on a management role for a team like this. I currently have little relevant experience, the closest being setting up a small FTP server in my bedroom and managing the file systems on my personal devices. In order to obtain the skills I require, I would complete my degree, and spend 2-3 years in team positions in educational organisations and non-profits, such that I gain a decent amount of experience in the field and make sure that it is actually what I would like to pursue.

## Personality
Below are the results of my Myers-Briggs Type Indicator test from <a href="http://www.16personalities.com">16personalities</a>: <br>

     alt="MBTI Test"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; width: 100%; border-radius: 5%"/> <br>
     
This shows that I have the ability to analyse and solve problems, and that I would have to be in a team of like minded people if I were to be managing them. It shows me personally that while an interpersonal connection may be initially difficult to establish, once that barrier is broken I can work well with them. This would make it difficult to build a team due to the selectivity of my personality, but maintaining a team after that should be like second nature.

And here are my results from a learning style test from <a href="http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml">Education Planner</a>: <br>
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/3Sg4DQc/learning-style.png"
     alt="Learning Style Test"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; width: 100%; border-radius: 5%"/> <br>
     
This test shows my ability to learn things in a multitude of ways, which would additionally help me when explaining things to others in a team. It shows me that I can gain a decent and broad understanding on topics regardless of the nature of the teaching. This would help me with problem solving and building a rapport within my team.

Finally, the results of a psychometric test from <a href="https://www.psychometricinstitute.com.au/free_psychometric_test.html">Institute of Psychometric Coaching</a>:<br>

     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; width: 100%; border-radius: 5%"/> <br>

Again this test shows my ability to quickly understand and solve a problem based on new information, as this test is based on pattern recognition and completion within a short timeframe. This is a useful attribute to hold in such a role, and would make it easier for me to assist other team members in the event of a problem in the system.

## Project Idea:
Below is an outline of the project I intend to complete during my studies this year.

### Overview
The aim of my project is to ease the process of expanding a user's music library by creating a system to aggregate their playlists. I will achieve this by using web integration from major streaming platforms and a script I develop myself. This will help to streamline the task by analysing the metadata of the music that the user already listens to and comparing it with similar music offered by the streaming platform. The following document will outline the process with which I intend to develop this app, and the challenges and obstacles I anticipate.

### Motivation
While the process of finding new music is already relatively simple, there are not many solutions currently available on the market that promote new artists. With my app I intend on providing users with a service that increases the exposure of new songs in the genres they have shown an interest in. The problem with current solutions is that the music recommended is based on the amount of other listeners that discovered the music organically, which takes a long time, and puts new artists at a disadvantage. When a user actively seeks to expand their music library, I aim to pair them with something similar that they haven't heard before. 

### Description
When it comes to expanding a music playlist, some people choose to use algorithms to help them discover more of what they like. These algorithms usually achieve this by looking at what other users with similar listening habits listen to, therefore the more popular a song is, the more likely it is to be recommended. This puts newer artists at a disadvantage when it comes to breaking through that barrier, as they have to work their way through already established artists on the way into someone's playlist. The listener is also being disadvantaged, as they won't end up discovering anything new based on these algorithms. To solve this problem, my aim is to develop a web app using the Spotify development API for integration, and create a custom script that analyses a user's playlist and recommends songs based off of new releases that better fit in with the music they already listen to. 

The algorithm I intend to create will need the input of an existing playlist by the user, at which point, it will use the Spotify development API tools to extract the songs metadata. From this it will be able to establish a general profile of the user's taste in music, extracting key elements like the length, artist, genre, and even the mood of the song, something that is generated by Spotify based on musical elements of the song. From this profile, it will begin looking for music that is similar but not identical that has been uploaded in the past month. The uploads from the past month should then be sorted such that artists not in the existing playlist are prioritised in order to increase the chances of the user finding something new.

Once the suggestion process is complete, the app will be able to create a playlist on the connected streaming account containing all the new songs. This will allow a seamless connection for the user to listen through the new songs at their own pace and add the ones they like to their playlist. By using a seperate playlist, it essentially quarantines the songs to wait for the users approval/judgement. Whilst this algorithm isn't going to guarantee only songs that the user will like, it is sure to provide them with a new experience, and support newer artists in a way that other algorithms have yet to manage. This prioritisation is what makes my algorithm unique.

In addition to the suggestion feature based on playlist, there will also be the option to search for individual songs. This approach will likely be less accurate, however, it will allow for users to utilise the system to find similar artists and music that they otherwise wouldn't have noticed. The accessibility of the final product is then greater, as this feature will not require the connection of a Spotify account to function.

In summation, the app will assist users in the discovery of new music using a unique algorithm. It will aim to prioritise providing the user with new artists in the hopes of successfully expanding their music library.

### Tools and Technologies
To develop this app, I will need to use html, css, and javascript in order to build the graphical user interface, and provide the script which the music metadata can be fed in to. Using streaming platform integration, I will be able to ascertain a users current musical interests, and also gain information of what new similar music has been released. The app will be developed using Atom, which is a free desktop text editor and compiler. I will also need to use my desktop computer and mobile device to test the app, and ensure its cross-platform capabilities.

### Skills Required
In order to develop this app, I will need to learn how to integrate a streaming platform and extract music metadata. I'll also have to develop an understanding of the Spotify development API, which will essentially allow me to access all the required data for this project. To keep my files organised, I will additionally need to learn how to use Github in the context of a large project such as this.

### Outcome
The overall goal of this project is to allow a user to easily discover new music that isn't entirely based on what other users are listening to, in turn providing new artists a way to enter the industry. The current 'solutions' to the problem when it comes to expanding a playlist look primarily at the commonalities between users, whereas my app aims to prioritise new releases. By providing this service, I hope to see more lesser known artists spread in popularity, and create more diversity in the end user's playlist.
